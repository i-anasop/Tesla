# 🚗 TESLA – Autonomous Driving Simulator (Python + Pygame)

A **Tesla-inspired autonomous driving simulator** built with Python & Pygame featuring AI that combines **Prolog-based safety logic**, **Minimax decision-making**, and **persistent learning**.  
The agent improves over time by remembering danger zones and avoiding past crash patterns.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The simulator models an autonomous vehicle navigating a multi-lane environment with:
- Traffic cars
- Pedestrian crossings
- Static obstacles (cones, barriers, broken vehicles)

The AI follows a structured pipeline:
1. Sensor interpretation
2. Safety logic (Prolog-style rules)
3. Strategy evaluation (Minimax)
4. Experience-based learning (JSON memory)

Result: Over multiple runs the agent becomes **safer & more efficient**.

## 📚 Core Features

### 🟣 Visual & UI
- Tesla-style futuristic UI
- Animated road & traffic
- Pedestrian crossings with indicators
- Dashboard with speed, radar, AI status

### 🚦 Environment
- Multi-lane road system
- Traffic cars with lane-aware behavior
- Pedestrian-first right-of-way
- Static obstacles & intersections

### 🤖 AI Intelligence
- **Sensors**: distance, lanes, pedestrians, speed
- **Prolog Rules** for safety (emergency braking, safe distance)
- **Minimax** for evaluating lane switching, braking, acceleration
- **Memory System**:
  - Stores crash zones (`memory.json`)
  - Avoids past danger lanes
  - Tracks skill progression → Learning → Skilled → Expert

---

## 🧩 Learning Summary

The car logs crashes as:
{ lane: X, position: Y }

yaml
Copy code
stored in `ai/memory.json`.

On next runs the agent:
✔ avoids those lanes  
✔ brakes earlier  
✔ becomes safer automatically  

Learning is **persistent across sessions**.
